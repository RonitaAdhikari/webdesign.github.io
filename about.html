            <h1>Why Foreign Languages Are Important?</h1>
        <p class="pa">People who know a foreign language have more scope of getting an international travel opportunity at work.<br> For students aspiring to study in Europe, China, Germany etc knowing their native language is a requirement for many courses.<br> Knowing a foreign language not only makes one more creative and intelligent but also more employable.</p></br>
        <p class="pa2">Research on foreign languages in advertising stresses the role of the match between product and language. Ads with a match are more effective; however, their effectiveness has not been compared to that of ads in the consumers native language, which are not restricted to products with a match, but are used for a range of products.<br> An experiment tested whether native ads were more effective than those utilizing foreign languages. We also took consumers foreign language proficiency into account.<br> Results suggest that foreign language is not the only key to success in advertising and effectiveness might also depend on the foreign language used</p></br>
